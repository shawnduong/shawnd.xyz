I'm really excited to announce that IrisSec is currently preparing for the National Cyber League Fall 2020 Season Team Game taking place this weekend! I've been very pleased with my own performance so far this season and I'm looking forward to seeing how far we can get during the team game this season.

Last season, my preseason rank was 141 out of 5379. This season, my preseason rank was 15 out of 6067. Last season, my individual rank was 75 out of 5357. This season, my individual rank was 25 out of 6008. Last season, our team rank was 15 out of 925. I'm really hoping that we can climb even higher this season!

Our lineup for this season is:
- skat
- Yoko Zoko
- nate
- [[nope]]
- codedninja
- sushi
- Duj

Looking forward to seeing how high we can fly this weekend!

Happy trails, \\
