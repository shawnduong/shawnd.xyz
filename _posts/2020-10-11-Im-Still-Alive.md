Hey. It's been a while, I know. I've been busy with a lot of things. A lot has happened since the last time I posted here. I'd rather not talk about what I've had to deal with from mid-August until now, but I assure you that I'm okay now. I'm up and kicking, and the world can't keep me down for too long.

Some life updates:

I'm still working for UC Merced Extension and I'm still working for UC Merced IT Network. I'm involved with the Solar Energy Association as their new secretary, and I'm glad to be continuing my contributions to environmental activism and sustainability. I'm in and out of the Association for Computing Machinery. I joined for their CTF team, but their CTF team hasn't done anything yet so I'm honestly losing interest and am considering leaving. I'm still the admin of and a board member of IrisSec, and we're participating in the National Cyber League, Fall 2020 season this year!

One of my co-workers at Extension and I founded a Discord server for UC Merced students to have an online community during the age of COVID, and it's been a great success and has really helped my mental health and loneliness. I'm still teaching Python as a passion project. I'm teaching some workshops soon for the Engineering Service Learning department at UC Merced!

This upcoming week is my midterm week. I have a video project for my Probability and Statistics class and a midterm lab project for my Data Structures class. That's a lot, honestly, especially on top of my pre-existing workload for Linear Algebra and Differential Equations and Engineering Professional Seminar, and especially on top of the National Cyber League Preseason Games which take place this week as well as the first workshop that I'm hosting for my university this Thursday. It's gonna be a busy week!

There's a blog post that I've been neglecting for a while. I'm gonna get that memory reel done soon, I swear. I just need to weather the storm first before I can relax and kick off my shoes.

Almost there. Until next time.

Happy trails,

Shawn
