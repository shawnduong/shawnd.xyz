Hey, happy holidays! I'm so happy that my fall semester is finally over. To be quite frank, I'm surprised that I got a 4.0 GPA this semester given that remote learning has been undoubtedly difficult. Now is the time to rest and relax and recharge for the next semester.

A vaccine for COVID has been developed and vaccinations are underway. I'm excited to get mine when the time comes around. In the meanwhile, I've been working on a number of side projects and writings. Namely, I'm writing a book on the importance of digital freedom, creating a program to help users manage and analyze their finances over time, and I'm working on web redesigns for my blog and for my personal website which I may merge in the future. Activism, programming, and web design.

The holidays this year have been understandably difficult, but we'll get through it. We always do.

Happy holidays.
