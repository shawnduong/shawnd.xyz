I'm very excited to announce that IrisSec has won the National Cyber League, Fall 2020 season! We ranked 1st place out of 957 total teams. It was an amazing season and a very close game, but we came out on top and gave it our 110% the entire way, and it paid off! Below is our team's scouting report as well as my individual scouting report. I improved my individual game performance this season and it goes without saying that our team improved massively during the team game performance, so this was a huge success all-around!
