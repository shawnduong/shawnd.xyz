title: Believe That Life Can Change, That You're Not Stuck in Vain
layout: post
---

Hey. It's been a while, I know. I've been really busy with school, work, projects, IrisSec, teaching, and so much more. I haven't forgotten about this long-awaited blog post that I first promised so, so long ago, but I'd understand you if you'd thought so.

This memory reel of my first year of college has been well overdue. I admit that I've let this become a secondary priority, buried beneath all the other things in the world that I did to push this off. Perhaps it's some sort of a defense mechanism, that my quarantine blues and loneliness chooses to avoid thinking of better times out of fear of creating a greater resentment for the present. Perhaps it is not so, and that I actually need this more than anything else right now to remind myself that this too shall pass, a cathartic exhuming of these emotions that have been buried deep within me yet not addressed for seemingly so long now.

If I look deep, then I know the latter to be true. I need this, for me.

## Irvine Valley College, 17 June 2019 -> 7 August 2019

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/IVC-0.jpg)

My first year of college starts off with community college. I took a summer semester at Irvine Valley College which started on the 17th of June, 2019, the Monday right after I had graduated from high school the Friday prior. It was so surreal for me, stepping into a college campus as a student for the first time ever.

Just the Friday before, I had spent the day celebrating with friends and family the tremendous achievement of having finished my Pre-K through 12 education, a total of 14 years that I had spent in the public school education system. I remember that before the ceremony had started, I was going around town. From the park to my local taco place by the intersection outside my neighborhood, to school where I shared some of those tacos, to walking my friend Tyler's dog Fluffy for a short while and saying goodbye to all my friends younger than me at school. I remember the ceremony and being there alongside my friends and I remember taking photos, celebrating, and eating at a mid-tier restaurant afterwards to cap my high school experience and ultimately, my 14 year experience in public education.

And now, as I stepped into Irvine Valley College, I realized that I had begun a new journey. I was no longer going through schooling to satisfy the law that says schooling is required, I was no longer going through schooling for the sake of going through schooling -- I was now going to school, studying, **for me**. That realization was so liberating and incredibly freeing, the simple understanding that everything I did from then on was my choice, for me, that I had made for myself and by myself.

I was taking the CS36 (C) course at Irvine Valley College. The professor was G. Cuevas, and I remember him being a pretty relaxed and laid-back guy. He was teaching the C programming language to us, a class that I was taking to knock out my CSE20 and CSE21 (Java I and II) requirements at UC Merced (although I ended up taking CSE21 voluntarily to learn Java). My most salient image of him,  the one burned into my mind as my "go-to" memory, is one of a balding, greying American man who wore tennis shoes, cargo shorts, and a blue AT-AT Star Wars shirt. If I had grown up stereotypically American, he'd be like an uncle at the barbecue.

My CS36 class I was taking was from 6 P.M. to 10 P.M., although we usually concluded at 9 P.M. as the last hour was for lab and most people just left around then. Usually, I came multiple hours early. I had classes Monday and Wednesday. Sometimes my sister would drive me as she worked nearby. More often than not, I'd take the bus. I remember those days I spent, wandering around campus, exploring, learning where things were, making stories up for locations and imagining what this school must look like when it's in session. Because it was in the summer, it was still bright as day by the time class started and the night was cool and dark, sometimes warm even, by the time class ended.

I remember the day I went to get my student ID. I didn't need a student ID. I wanted one. I went to the police station located on-campus, they took my picture, and printed me a student ID right then and there for completely free. It's something that I have to this day, a memory of that summer I spent there.

I remember those nights I spent in that classroom, sometimes struggling to stay awake because I had not gotten much sleep the night prior (my insomnia was back that summer). Usually, I left around the end of lecture (but start of lab) at 9 P.M. just like most others, but on some nights, I stayed afterwards to talk with others. Although most people in that class have faded in my memory by now, there are still 2 people I remember: Mitch, and Gary. Mitch was a student at CSULB and Gary was an incoming freshman at UCR. They were my first college friends.

Above all, I remember those long nights I spent waiting for the bus. There was a bus that came around 9:46 P.M. if I remember correctly. There was another bus that came after 10 P.M. as well in case I decided to stay for lab that long. I remember wandering the dark and empty campus in the cool summer night air, feeling alone yet in such a way not like involuntary loneliness but rather like much needed solitude.

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/IVC-2.jpg)

Sometimes, on those nights, while waiting for the bus would I text a girl I had fallen in love with that summer. I remember our conversational back-and-forths and the feeling of having someone else there to share the night with in my solitude, even if she wasn't physically there. I believe that's what is meant by the phrase, "Alone, together."

The bus only took me so far, stopping by the intersection outside my neighborhood and leaving me to walk the rest in the 11 P.M. or so summer night. Something that really sticks in my mind were the passengers I'd see on the bus. At the start of the night, the bus was empty with just myself in it as Irvine Valley College was the first stop on the nightly route. At certain stops, more people would get on, more people would get off, and I'd understand more about the community and the world I had grown up in but had simply not observed the night life of for so long. For instance, I observed that at one stop, a large number of day workers would come on the bus and their crowd would slowly die down as we arrived at more and more stops. I observed that these men must work with each other until the late night, and likely took public transportation to and from since they obviously didn't seem to be driving to and from work. I gained such a deep and profound respect for that kind of a lifestyle, understanding that they work all day and even into the late, late night (when I would be on the bus), probably to make ends meet for their families back home.

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/IVC-3.jpg)

Riding the bus home on those late nights gave me a greater understanding of the sorts of lifestyles I had grown up in proximity of all my childhood. It made me understand that everyone had a story. All the people taking the bus late at night had a story to tell, whether they're kids out having fun and enjoying their teenage years, or whether they're day workers working hard around the clock to make ends meet and coming home to a loving family that had already gone to bed. Regardless, I learned more respect for the lifestyles of those around me. I theorized that perhaps they, too, had formulated theories of where I was coming home from too as I was a regular on that bus. Perhaps they thought that I was a teenager and that I was coming home from my friend's place, or perhaps they thought that I was working a job at a boba joint or something and was just coming home after a long shift, or perhaps they correctly landed on the assumption that I must have been a student taking a late night class.

On the day of the final, which I had aced and finished the class off with an A, Mitch, Gary, and I went to go get Korean BBQ. It is, and will always, be one of my favorite memories of that summer. The 7th of August, 2019. After that night, we went our separate ways. A good ending to a happy story.

## Orientation, 27 July 2019

My first experience with UC Merced was at orientation, the 27th of July. It was the first time I had actually seen the campus aside from pictures and virtual tours, and so obviously it holds a special place in my heart. I was traveling alone for the first time ever, so far away from home, and I bought a camera to capture the journey of the travel with me.

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/la-union.jpg)

I remember taking the late midnight Pacific Surfliner train that left around 10 P.M. or 11 P.M. to L.A., then taking a bus to Bakersfield, and then taking a train to Merced but being delayed in Fresno for approximately an hour. On that train ride, I finished my final project for my CS36 class at Irvine Valley College. I was scheduled to arrive in Merced at 7 A.M. that morning, but because my train was delayed and stuck in Fresno for an hour, I didn't arrive until past 8 A.M. which was past the soft start time of the orientation.

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/fresno.jpg)

Because I was late, I could not link up with my friends to get to school like we had originally intended to. I reached out to the UC Merced Classifieds Facebook group page and luckily someone quickly responded to my post and was able to drive me to orientation where I had arrived late. They dropped me off at the basketball gymnasium that was being used for orientation that day, and I rushed into the building after thanking them endlessly for their kindness. I met up with two of my friends there: Maria, and Kira.

I still remember my orientation group so long after, actually. Yellow color, team 4. We listened to a few informational briefings and presentations in the large COB lecture hall and to be frank, I was about to fall asleep during them since they were the typical bureaucracy chatter and I had not slept all journey the night prior. We did a lot of fun activities, although I struggle to remember the specifics or who was in my group doing these activities with me.

The memories of the day were mostly lost to my then sleep deprived brain, although I remember sitting in an air-conditioned room in SSM and having a college talk. We wrote down some commitments and things we'd try to do during college, and I personally wrote that I would try to get on Dean's List for at least 2 consecutive semesters, which I did! I remember meeting someone, Fabian, a mathematics major, and we exchanged phone numbers and got along well. We ended up living on the same dorm floor as we discovered later that year, and as a result, we often times ran into each other although we never really did become close friends.

For lunch that day, I ate with Maria and this girl that she had met: Eileen, a very pretty girl who had come up from San Diego with her dad. We ate outside at the Pavilion, on the patio, talking about how our orientation had gone so far and telling each other about our backgrounds and where we came from in life.

In the afternoon, I went to talk to an academic advisor in the library's upstairs computer rooms in order to get all of my AP credits transferred so that I could sign up for courses typical of a sophomore. I brought my transcripts with me, including both AP and my in-progress transcript from Irvine Valley College. She got it sorted out for me and I became a sophomore in only a few minutes!

I wandered around campus for a little longer. I remember wandering into the student store and I decided to splurge a little bit and bought a UC Merced hoodie that I still have and wear proudly today.

My friends let me hitch a ride with them back to the train station since the buses weren't running that day. I remember sitting in that car, seeing the beautiful city and greenery and small-town glory. I fell in love with Merced that day, and I felt a connection to what would become my new home. I got to the train station an hour later or so before my train would come, and then it came, picked me up, and then the Merced-Bakersfield-L.A.-S.A. journey happened again for what would not be the last time.

I got picked up by my dad from the train station around 3 A.M. that night. I remember the orange lights of Santa Ana station draping over me on that night, dark, in the aisles of that train station, under the hood of the night, fiery, blurred by my fatigue but inviting and comfortable in a beautiful somber summer tone.

## My First Job Interview, c. August 2020

My first job interview was for UC Merced IT - Academic and Emerging Technology. This took place around a week or two before the semester started. I had heard about the position on the UC Merced student jobs website and I decided to send in an application as well as inform my soon-to-be roommate, Intiser, about the position so that they could apply too. I got an email not too long after and they requested an in-person interview. I was very excited as this was the first time I'd ever had a professional interview in-person before. I booked my train tickets, prepared my suit, and headed off.

It wasn't smooth sailing by any means. My train in Santa Ana was delayed by a few hours due to some fires or a collision or whatever down the tracks south. I actually ended up getting on the *wrong* train just so that I could get to L.A. on time, which I suppose technically makes me a train hopper.

At L.A. Union Station, I sat for hours in the night at the waiting area they have. I specifically remember sitting in the section closest to the buses since I was on edge that night and wanted to be sure I could book it if any more fast ones were pulled on me. There was a situation unfolding that night. A very loud man, security and police officers, someone on the floor, paramedics, and an arrest were all I could remember from inside L.A. Union. It was scary, and there was this young woman who couldn't have been too much older than me sitting across from me in that lounge as well. We made eye contact and exchanged a look of mutual understanding and sympathy for the situation at hand unfolding in front of everyone that night.

When the connecting bus finally came a few hours later, we actually started talking and I found out that she had actually gone to UC Merced and had just graduated from there last semester as a Management and Business Economics major. She gave me some insight about the school, talked a bit about her experiences, and then we got separated on the bus where I sat at a table seat with a man who chatted a bit with me that night. He was a bit older and actually had a lot of experiences with the city of Merced. He told me his life story, about how he was born in Merced but moved to Southern California later on in life and was currently a wanderer at the then-present. Somewhere down the line, the bus quieted down, and the air was still inside. It continued moving through the night outside to catch deadlines and arrival times, and I fell asleep to the warm lights outside whizzing by us like stars in the still-too sky.

We got to Bakersfield and then I got on my train heading north to Merced. When I got there, I took the G Line shuttle to get to campus. The bus driver was very nice and I remember him having a conversation with one of the students sitting near the front of the bus the entire ride. I got off at the recreation center bus stop on campus and frankly, I was lost. My interview was somewhere in COB2, but I had never been there before. A custodian noticed my Sierra Club bag and complimented me on it as she was a supporter of environmentalism as well, and she noticed I was lost and gave me some directions. I eventually found my way to the correct room after having wandered and stumbled for a little bit as expected.

I met another girl just before the interviewers arrived: Cindy, a 4th year who was going to UC Merced for Mechanical Engineering. Joining us for the interview was another interviewee, Josue, and then finally the two interviewers, Rachel and Jodon. The interview featured a mix of the basic personality and technical questions in addition to those "What would you do in x scenario?" questions. The further the interview went on, the more I realized that I was not a good fit for the job and the job was not a good fit for me. The job seemed to be more front-end technical support and the student team was already pretty large in size. If a professor was in the middle of teaching a class and a projector broke, then it would be my job to go in and mitigate the problem.

I was informed later by email that I didn't get the job, which I don't feel at all bitter about because I realized that I would not have enjoyed working as one cog in a large team doing front-end IT. Because I was fresh and inexperienced, I supposed I had a very misguided idea of what tasks entailed that position. What I did get, though, was a new friend: Cindy. We connected through Facebook after the interview, and we're actually still friends to this day.

## Moving In, 25 August 2019

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/dorm-0.jpg)

It was a Sunday when I moved in. A few days prior, I had arranged for my minimalist collection of items to be taken up to Merced by one of my friends. Saturday night, I took the train up to Merced and by Sunday morning, I had arrived at the train station in Merced. I took an Uber to get to campus. I remember seeing the trees and buildings pass by outside the car and thinking, "This is my new home."

When I had arrived on campus, it was still early morning. It was much earlier than my scheduled move-in time, but I made my way to Half Dome and asked the people helping with move-in if it was okay for me to go in and because there was no traffic yet, they didn't have a problem. I got my key and took the elevator up to floor 3 of Half Dome and met an RA named Kaitlyn. When she asked me what room I was, I told her 351. She misheard me and thought that she was my RA and led me down her hall while we were also having casual conversation. We quickly realized our miscommunication and she showed me to my actual room which was, funnily enough, just right outside the elevator to the right. My RA was actually Melissa although as the year went on, Kaitlyn felt more like my RA since she was there more often.

I inserted the key, opened the door, and saw my room. One of my three roommates, Intiser, had moved in a few days prior to receive training for his job at IT - AET. When I had first entered the room, he was in the top bunk right above mine. The shades were down and the room was dim. That was the first time we'd met in-person.

We got breakfast at the Pavilion. Around noon, my friend Maria had arrived and I went to her dorm in Mariposa to get my belongings that she'd brought up for me. Around this time, everyone was moving in and foot traffic was heavy. While I was moving my stuff from Mariposa to Half Dome, I ran into Eileen who was volunteering to help out with move-in. We chatted for a little bit and then I continued to push my move-in cart across campus to my dorm. I unpacked, moved in, took the middle desk, and got settled.

Intiser and I got lunch and later dinner with his friend whose name I'm forgetting and will simply refer to as M. Around the afternoon, our 2 remaining roommates moved in: Matthew, and Juan. With those two moved in, our room was complete.

One of the memories I had of this day was a mandatory dorm floor meeting attended by everyone under one of the three RAs. There, I met the others on my floor. I remember for an ice breaker question, Melissa passed around a roll of toilet paper and asked us how much we used, and we all ripped off a certain length. Then, based on the length, we had to tell the room a certain number of things about ourselves. I remember one of the things I mentioned during mine was that I was the leader of a computer hacking team, and I mentioned being very proud of them and being very proud of my position as the administrator and leader at IrisCS (now IrisSec).

Jacey, the Resident Education Coordinator, came and gave us the rules, policies, and procedures.

I had a job interview for UC Merced Extension at the Downtown Campus Center the day right after so I went to sleep early at night at 10 P.M. so that I could wake up by 6 A.M. the morning after.

## My Second Job Interview, 26 August 2019

The Monday right after move-in, I had a job interview for UC Merced Extension. I woke up early, suited up, took the G Line shuttle to downtown, walked around downtown for a bit, and then finally made my way to the UC Merced Downtown Campus Center. The interview right before mine was Cindy's, who I had previously met from our group interview at IT - AET and who I encouraged to apply for Extension.

When Cindy's interview ended, mine started. I met three people: Michael, Adam, and Allison. The questions, like the interview I had with IT - AET, were primarily a mix of personality, technical, and scenario questions. Unlike IT - AET, the more this interview went on, the more I realized that the job was a great fit for me and I was a great fit for the job. 

The interview went great! I impressed myself with the amount of confidence I was able to portray, and I impressed the interviewers. Adam even asked me, "Are you sure you're a first year?" in response to my impressive resume and track record. I walked out of that interview feeling great and proud of myself, having successfully displayed the best of myself to the interviewers and more importantly, having successfully displayed the best of myself *to myself*. I recall one of the things that really impressed them was when they asked for my schedule and instead of having to stumble around and recall my schedule, I just casually pulled a prepared visual of my availability on a typical week from my folder. Preparedness goes a long way!

I toured downtown Merced for just a little bit longer and checked out a few of the squares and shops that they had. I got a little bit lost on the bus system when the Route UC stopped at the Merced Transit Center and I had to hop from one bus to another, but I eventually made it back to campus.

A few days later, I got a call from Michael saying that I had gotten the job! I accepted, and not too long after, I met with him at the on-campus UC Merced Visitor Center to fill out some paperwork and formally accept my position on paper. Over the next few days, I arranged with my family back home to send me some documents so that I could fulfill my I-9 document requirements.

I had landed my first real, professional job! I was officially a Student Technology and Classroom Support Coordinator for UC Merced Extension! This job turned out to be everything that I wanted, and more, and I am still there to this day! I work with an amazing supervisor, amazing coworkers, and in an amazing environment, and I can confidently say that this is the best job I've ever had.

## Starting at UC Merced Extension, c. September 2019

One of my earliest memories working for UC Merced Extension was receiving some orientation from Michael and Adam. I got picked up from the little pick-up area right behind Half Dome by Cindy, and there in the car I met Grace, my other coworker, for the first time. We were running just a tad bit short on time, but we eventually made it to the Downtown Campus Center with just a few minutes to spare.

We all entered a little conference room and got to know each other a little bit more through some icebreaker questions and team bonding questions. Then, Michael and Adam told us more about the job and the responsibilities that included, as well as giving us a tour of the Downtown Campus Center and some of the spaces we could be expecting the work in.

Another early memory was receiving some mandatory basic IT training from Rachel, the same woman who interviewed me for IT - AET. It was nothing too out of the box, just an overview of the interfaces we'd be using to interact with the peripherals as well as a quick solution-finding procedure to use when something goes wrong. One of the things I remember in particular about that day was seeing Grace in the lobby area at a table while waiting for the training to start, and noticing and commenting on her Ubuntu necklace. It's rare to find another Linux user in the wild!

My initial schedule was pretty set and straightforward: clock in at 6:45 P.M. on Wednesdays, resolve any technical issues that may arise at the Teacher Preparation Program being hold at those times, and then clock out at 10 P.M. later that night. I'd usually take the G line right after my PHYS8 (Physics I) class was done, get dropped off in downtown, and walk to the Downtown Campus Center. For the first few nights, I couldn't say the same about the journey back as the G line didn't run so late and thus could not take me back to campus past 10 P.M., so I would walk all the way to the bus stop near Yum Yum Donuts and get picked up by the C1 line. However, the classes held at the Teacher Preparation Program ended up finishing closer to 8:30 P.M. or so after the first week or two, and so I could walk to the Amtrak station nearby and get picked up by the G line heading back home.

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/amtrak-0.jpg)

One of the most salient sets of memories I have not just of working at Extension, but of my entire first year of college, were those long Wednesday nights that I spent. The calm and stillness of the Downtown Campus Center after all the teachers and students had finished class, the strange feeling of sonder I felt as I went through the then-empty classrooms making sure that all peripherals were properly shut off, checking off my checkboxes, breaking the classrooms down to their default configuration, and then clocking out for the night but not after wishing the security guard Lupe (who was usually the only other person in the building at that time) a goodnight. I remember the cool breeze of the night, the unmoving night air, the summer-felted sky and the glowing city lights, the dark neighborhoods and rarely passing cars, as I walked to the Amtrak station to catch the last bus home.

It was usually the same bus driver every night and I always made sure to greet them with a "Good evening" and leave them with a "Goodnight." I remember laying my head against the window as the bus rattled through the city as I listened to my nightly music through my earbuds, oftentimes dozing off and nearly falling asleep as night's sleepy blanket was pulled over me, ready to fall asleep and ready to close my eyes for eight hours if only I were not struggling so hard to keep them open.

The white lights of the bus contrasting so much with the dark world outside of me, the lights of the passing streetlamps and cars and businesses and establishments. What I remember most was that feeling of relief as if my burdens and concerns had been divested every single time I saw the grasses and plains slowly reveal my university campus in the distance, the same feeling that someone gets when they've been away from home for so long and drive through their hometown and are hit with the relief of being finally home, of being safe, secure, and ensured a warm welcoming back.

By the time I had usually gotten back, campus was dark but not asleep just yet. There were still people walking both to and from the Pavilion, people chatting with their friends in common areas, and just about everyone was still awake either studying or socializing.

Of all the songs that I had listened to on those long Wednesday nights, on those bus rides home, perhaps none were more salient than "Tonight, Tonight" by The Smashing Pumpkins. It captured the calmness of the night so beautifully, the hours of much-needed solitude that I got, the feelings of nostalgia and understanding that my life as it was then was so different than the life I had 10 years ago. The song kissed me goodnight as I dozed to sleep on the bus ride home and eventually, dozed to sleep in my bed back in my dorm on campus.

I will never regret nor forget such beautiful memories made in the hours during the sleep of the city, the hours of night and like a mother tucking a child to bed as they fall asleep under a star-painted ceiling in the calm quietness of a suburb. If I could, I would do it all over again. I'd give it all to relive those memories, just for one night, those memories I hope I shall never forget to time and age.

## Studying RFID, c. Early September 2019

Sometime in late August, my roommates and I had the idea of hacking the school's RFID CatCard scanners so that we could get access into other dorm buildings without needing to ask a friend on the inside to open the door for us. The plan was simple: find out how the RFID scanners worked, ask our friends if we could clone their cards (in exchange for giving them a cloned copy of ours), and clone cards! When I say "my roommates and I," it was really just me with the other two being observers. I was really the only one out of the three of us with the hacker mindset and knowledge.

I sank many, many hours into that project. I even ordered an Arduino RFID kit and did a bit of soldering and breadboarding to make the project work. Unfortunately, in the end, nothing came out of it as the CatCards were working on more modern and secure technology. If I remember correctly, the internal wiring of the CatCard meant that unless the proper public key derived from the private key owned by the HID company (the manufacturer of the cards) was transmitted within proximity of the card, the card would not transmit RFID back. I was impressed that so much logic fit into a card so thin!

The school's CatCards didn't have the same vulnerability as older RFID systems that were susceptible to cloning and replay attacks. Impressive! Nonetheless, I walked away from the venture with a greater respect for the cybersecurity of the school as well as a greater understanding of RFID technology, so it was not a venture in vain.

## Friends, c. September 2019

All while my Wednesdays were being occupied by work, my other days were spent making friends back home on campus. Intiser and I were already friends, and we had made friends with our other roommate Matthew. We did almost everything together. I remember those hot summer days when we'd relax in the first floor game room playing billiards or ping pong. Sometimes we'd hang out with Maria and Kira too. We had our own inside jokes based out of things like my love of Philip Glass, spinach, peanut butter, and saltine crackers, Intiser's weeb stuff, Lasagna Cat (which Matthew and I tried to commit to memory), stealing kneecaps, and other wacky things. Everything was good. Everything was working. I had started college, gotten my first real, professional job, was doing well in my classes, and was making friends. I was living the college experience and I loved it.

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/campus-0.jpg)

Intiser was seeing a girl named Kay around that time. I remember one night, she invited myself, Intiser, and Matthew to go to a college party. Frankly, I didn't like it too much and felt out of place as if I didn't belong at such a function. It was the 7th of September, that night. We got an Uber or Lyft back home and spent the night stargazing by the pond, listening to music, laying down and seeing the sky above.

Somewhere in September, Matthew, Intiser, and I were in the study lounge on the floor and this girl named Iris came in and asked for help moving her furniture as her dorm was just down the hall perpendicular to ours. She was supposed to be in a quad but three of her roommates never showed up and so she was basically in a single the size of a quad. Matthew and Intiser helped her, but I stayed in the study room to continue working on a math problem that was boggling my mind and had me stuck. They finished a few hours later, and then came back for me and we all got food at the Pavilion together. We had made a new friend and our friend group incorporated her friend group to include Priscilla and Evelin now.

I remember later that night, we were in her dorm room and we were just casually getting to know each other. It was calm, it was peaceful, and I'd made three new friends. Her room was basically like a clubhouse because she liked having company and her roommates never showed up, so many of those early summer nights were spent in there watching movies, the days spent in there socializing with each other and getting to know each other better, and we almost always ate together too. Everything was good.

For the first time in a long, long time, I felt like I was really a part of a friend group and not merely an outsider looking in. I remember somewhere down the line, Iris got an electric scooter. We rolled around campus everywhere. Matthew had my old bike, Intiser had his bike, Priscilla had her blue bike that she called "Cotton," Iris and Evelin would ride the scooter together, and I had my longboard... Caoimhe.

## Building Caoimhe, c. Mid September 2019

Somewhere around mid-September, I felt a need to fill a hole that had been in my for well over a year by then: longboarding. I ordered the parts off of Skateshred and on the little table outside of Half Dome, under the setting sun and with my two friends Intiser and Matthew with me, I built Caoimhe. 48 inches of longboard beauty. Starry galaxy grip tape. Blue wheels and metal trucks. I put Caoimhe together that night.

I remember Priscilla and Evelin coming out of Half Dome in the middle of it and they stopped to see me put together this project. Evelin and I recall that as being the first time that we had actually "met" as before we were really just passersby and had never really talked to each other.

I remember putting my feet on top of Caoimhe's 48 inch maple deck and my knees becoming weak, my balance shaky. It had truly been so, so long since I had last ridden a longboard. In a couple of minutes of stumbling, I had gotten it back. I was rolling again.

Many of these memories in this memory reel involve or take place during the night, I'm starting to notice.

## Being Visited by Kimberly, c. Late September 2019

Around late September, my friend Kimberly came up to visit me on a weekend. Her brother drove her all the way up and she arrived in the early morning, where I greeted her with breakfast at the Pavilion, a tour of the school, and we caught up on the life that had passed by since we had last seen each other.

As early morning transitioned into late morning, I introduced her to my friends that I had made minus Evelin as she was out for the weekend visiting her family back at home. We hung out, talked a lot, and somehow we ended up at Target doing a Target run. She got blue hair dye and was going to dye her hair, but it went horribly wrong and she ended up wearing a beanie to cover it up after cleaning the dye out of the sinks in the bathroom.

We watched a movie that night. What specific movie, I cannot recall, although I believe it was The Shining. I can't remember if she stayed for two or three days, but what I do remember is falling asleep during the movie on the floor and according to the others, I was snoring that night. I remember waking up the morning after and Priscilla let Kimberly borrow her CatCard so that she could get on the bus to the train station, and we said our goodbyes at the Amtrak stop and I returned to campus that early noon to give Priscilla her CatCard back.

## The Heatwave, c. September -> October 2019

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/campus-1.jpg)

One of the things about Merced in the summer is that it gets dreadfully, truly dreadfully, hot. The summer heatwave was in full blast and the sun was beating down on us in all of her fiery rage. We did plenty of things to stay cool that summer. It was common for myself, Intiser, and Matthew, and sometimes the others in our later-extended friend group to go to the Marketplace and get some smoothies, yogurt, or ice cream to relieve us of some of the heat.

We stayed indoors a lot and avoided going outside into the blistering sun. Around the late afternoons to early evenings, the temperature would drop enough to the point where we could go outside and it was warm or cool. Luckily for us, the dorms were air-conditioned. On particularly hot days, I would sometimes choose to walk to class instead of skating to class as skating would have made me too sweaty by the time I'd arrive. I often wore long-sleeved outfits and a cap to protect myself from sunburn, but at the expense of feeling a bit more insulated and heated underneath.

One of those days, when it was less sweltering outside and actually somewhat cool, Matthew and I decided to clean out his PC since I had a duster and thermal paste. I remember us setting up camp at the barbecue table in the courtyard area in The Summits, and I had recorded most of it in the case that I forgot how to undo the disassembly.

Sometimes, the three of us roommates would go to the Den and play billiards there in the daytime when we could between our classes. It was either the Den or the game room on the first floor. We'd often hang out with our extended friend groups. We didn't seem to have much trouble making friends or becoming moderately known around campus.

## The First Rainfall, c. September or October 2019

I can't remember what day it was specifically, but I remember the first rainfall of the semester taking place sometime during September or October. It was the first time that I had seen UC Merced under showering skies. The campus, which was usually very bustling and bright, became dimmer and darker and the crowds less dense.

Should I dig into my mind and retrieve a photograph of the day, I find myself looking outside the window of the corner outside the elevator on the third floor of Half Dome looking out to the scenery outside, admiring the rain and feeling so comfortable. I'm a big lover of rainy weather when I'm either not outside or when there's no immediate reason for me to worry about the rain. I love the sound of raindrops and I love the darker skies and wetter settings and the overall chaotic yet calmness attribute of the rain.

## Joining UC Merced Sustainability, c. October 2019

Sometime during October, I saw a post on the UC Merced Classifieds Facebook page talking about how UC Merced Sustainability was looking for new volunteers. I wanted to continue my contributions to environmentalism and sustainability in college as an extension of my high school experience, and so naturally I felt a calling and applied.

I couldn't attend the regularly scheduled orientation due to an overlap with one of my classes, but luckily there was a second orientation date and time for people who couldn't go to the first. I met with a woman named Allajah who was basically my supervisor at UC Merced Sustainability, and I met with a few fellow volunteers. It was a really calm and quiet meeting at the SRE building on campus, but I really felt myself vibing with them and the program and I was really excited to start.

I clocked in my first volunteer shifts on the 19th of October, 2019, from 9:30 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. with a one hour lunch break in-between. It was a homecoming event if memory serves, and UC Merced Sustainability was tabling. I hope my memory serves me correctly here, but I believe that we were doing a trash-ketball event. It was basically where people tried to sort trash based on whether it's trash, compost, or recycling. We did a lot to educate the community that day and we gave away a lot of prizes!

From 11:30 A.M. to 12:30 P.M. I took a lunch break and met Priscilla and Evelin to get lunch at the Pavilion as I believe the others were busy or out of town. That was a really good Saturday. I bought back some leftover prizes for them that afternoon: foldable silicon reusable straws.

## Joining UC Merced Robotics Society, 17 October 2019

Sometime during the middle of October, I was walking back from what was probably my MATH22 class when I saw a bunch of clubs tabling on Scholar's Lane. One of them struck out to me as particularly interesting as they had a robot on display. They were the robotics society at UC Merced. I asked them a little bit about the club, signed my name saying that I was interested, and took a flyer with me.

I got back to my dorm and told my roommate Matthew all about it. He was hesitant to join, but I dragged him to a general meeting the night of the 17th from 6:30 to 7:30 and well, we were in.

At the meeting, they went over a bunch of projects that they doing. None of them spoke out to me particularly besides one: BattleBots. I was so stoked to learn how to design and make robots that fought each other. I joined the BattleBots division and started to attend meetings for BattleBots.

## First Midterms, c. October 2019

Around October, we started to take our first midterms. The former relaxation in the air was now replaced with stress, and we all suddenly had less free time as we focused on passing and scoring well on our midterms.

I remember spending many, many nights in study rooms and my dorm just studying, studying, and studying. For my MATH22 (Calculus II) class that I was taking that semester, I had even gone as far as writing out my reference sheets in LaTeX just so that they could be neat and organized. I was committed to passing all my first midterms.

And pass I did! I remember my score for the first MATH22 being one of the highest in the class and near perfect. Having come from a programming background long before college started, I found the CSE21 midterm to be easy. I didn't get the grade I wanted on my PHYS8 midterm, but it was higher than the class average but a significant degree so I was happy with my score.

## Hide and Seek, Meeting Evelin, c. Mid October 2019

Sometime in mid-October, Iris told us that her friend from back home was coming up to visit her. We stayed up late that night in anticipation of her friend coming in the late night or early morning, doing things to keep ourselves awake. I remember that night, dimly lit in Iris's dorm, and we were playing Uno on the double mattress (two beds pushed together). I remember calling with Kimberly that night, and I remember meeting someone, again, but in a different way: Evelin. Sure, we had "met" twice before. Once when we were first in the same friend group that night that Iris got her furniture rearranged and we all went to go get food at the Pavilion. Once when she and Priscilla bumped into me building my longboard with Matthew and Intiser. Yet, somehow I felt that that night, we had *actually* met.

One of the things we did that night was play hide and seek throughout the entire dorm building. I remember finding Priscilla hidden behind a wall in a study room and Evelin in the closet in a lounge, but Matthew and Iris I had to give up on. Matthew was hidden in a spot underneath one of the stairwells, and Iris was hidden underneath a couch.

Somehow, although I barely remember much about that night, that night stands out as one of my favorites. It stands out as the night that I met Evelin, someone who would eventually become a much bigger part of my life than a mere passerby in my story.

## An Offer from UC Merced IT Network, c. Mid October 2019

Around mid October, I got an unexpected phone call. It was from a man named Keith Hughes (who, spoiler alert, is now my supervisor and a great mentor) and he wanted to interview me for a position that I had applied to in the summer back when I was job searching. I was initially hesitant to say "yes" to the offer for an interview as I had already landed a position at UC Merced Extension, but I've never said "no" to exciting new opportunities before as I've made my way through life and so I agreed to an interview.

The interview was scheduled to take place at the Downtown Campus Center where I worked for UC Merced Extension on the 18th of October, 2019. I remember the security guard that day greeting me, asking if I was on shift, to which I told him that I was actually there to interview for another job. Keith brought me into a conference room with another man, Al Espinoza.

Long story short, the interview went great! I recall that one of the things that we talked about during the interview, going slightly off-topic, was a recent privilege escalation vulnerability in Bash. I also remember talking about how I had some experience setting up small-time network-related things on a Raspberry Pi for the hell of it out of curiosity.

Something that I think really differentiates me from the typical applicant is the hacker mindset. I'm curious, and I can't stop being curious. At every single step of the way, I want to know more. I'm driven by knowledge and understanding and it's how I feel that I most truly develop genuine appreciations for subjects. IT Network gave me an opportunity to know more.

I got a call a week or two later saying that I had been accepted and that I could start in early November. I was now balancing two jobs, and yet, I still felt that I had too much free time.

## Starting Office Hours at Extension, 28 October 2019

On the 28th of October, I clocked in my first set of office hours at UC Merced Extension. I caught the bus after my morning MATH22 class so that I could get there in time for my shift at 12. It was the first time I had ever been to UC Merced's Promenade offices location and admittedly, it was pretty hard for me to find. In fact, I was so lost that I had to call my supervisor (who was in the office) for help getting to where I needed to be. My CatCard gave me access to the building and inside was a calm, serene, and still atmosphere.

My supervisor introduced me to the people around the office and gave me a quick tour of the place. This was the place where I would be spending my Monday afternoons from then on for the rest of the semester. I set up at the same desk every time I'd clock in and most of my tasks there usually involved assisting with data digitization and other miscellaneous tasks at the office.

When I clocked out later, I made my way to the bus stop to be picked up by the CatTracks and come back to campus. I was in no rush. The only classes I had that day were MATH22 in the morning from 9:30 to 10:30, and PHYS8 from 4:30 to 5:45 in the afternoon. I remember taking a selfie while waiting for the bus and posting it to my private Instagram, talking about how I was so happy to have my job at Extension and about how I was so happy to start my job soon at UC Merced IT Network. 

There were many shops at the Promenade, but the only one I'd go to on rare occasions was the Starbucks by the bus stop. I'm not really a Starbucks kind of person but every now and then, I'd indulge. It's a strange ritual, really. It was something that made me "feel" like I was a college student. Sometimes, conformity is comfort, and I don't mind.

On Wednesdays, I'd work at the Downtown Campus Center from 6:45 P.M. to 10 P.M., Fridays a meeting from 11 A.M. to 12 P.M., and Mondays I was now working at the Promenade from 12 P.M. until 3 P.M. It was a nice life that I was living.

## Starting at UC Merced IT Network, 30 October 2019

On the 30th of October, a Wednesday, I clocked into my first shift at UC Merced IT Network at the on-campus telecommunications building. I must admit that I had a bit of trouble finding the place as a first year with zero sense of direction, but luckily Keith found me showed me around the place. On Wednesdays, I'd clock in at 10:30 A.M. right after my MATH22 class and clock out at 1:00 P.M right before my CSE21 class. On Fridays, I'd work from 12:30 P.M. until 5 P.M. which was really nice since the only class I had on Fridays was MATH22 in the morning and besides that, the only other thing I had that day was a weekly team meeting with Extension which was done virtually through Zoom.

A lot of my tasks at first were audits, inventory, and other mundane things. I powered through it. The exposure was valuable, and I kept going while being driven by the idea that I had to do the boring stuff first before I could get to the exciting stuff. I didn't really work with anyone else during my shifts as we didn't overlap, but I did know that there were 3 others on the student team that year.

## Autumn Memories, November 2019

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/campus-2.jpg)

October and November were perhaps the most memorable months of my first year experience at UC Merced. If I were to go back in my memory, I can very explicitly recall memories of being in an early morning MATH22 class or discussion and struggling to stay awake, in a PHYS8 discussion or lab with my now-friend Alex and being confused together, being in a slow-paced (for me) CSE21 class or demoing my lab to a TA who spoke so quietly and softly that I could barely hear her half of the time, or in my SPRK class talking to only two other people in the class: Ashley and Ronin, who, sadly, our friendships didn't continue beyond the classroom.

SPRK was probably my favorite class that semester. I was actually learning new things and the small class size reminded me of high school. I was taking Evolution of Electronics which was really cool for me since I'd been trying to get into hardware, circuits, and electronics in general for a while. It was a really great class.

If I were to go back in my memory, I can very explicitly recall memories of volunteering for sustainability, going to Robotics meetings for my BattleBots team, walking to the bus stop late at night under the cool autumn air and under the dim moonlight. There was a corner store that I'd stop by sometimes on my walk to the bus stop to buy some candy or other treat to give me some comfort.

I remember those cool afternoons on campus and being amazed by the trees actually changing color -- something that I didn't witness back home in Southern California. I remember skating through the night, making my way through school, and letting time pass one day at a time during the autumn season when the ants have gone away.

## Friendship Drama, Loneliness, and Despair, c. Mid November 2019

Around mid-November, our friend group unfortunately went through some drama involving secrets, lies, deceit, and all the typical buzzwords. I won't dive too in-depth into the details here, but it essentially all centered around me feeling that a few others in the group didn't respect my privacy after a specific incident and snooped into bits and pieces of my life that I prefer to keep to myself.

I dealt with the loneliness for a while as the situation was blurry and continuing to unblur. I dealt with the despair, the feeling that I was alone yet again, the feeling that I had somehow sabotaged my own first-year college experience although today it's been accepted that I was the victim, not the perpetrator. I recall very explicit memories of walking through campus late at night, going to a private and desolate spot behind the SE2 building and talking to myself, being alone with my thoughts, and being comforted by my music, folding leaves under the November moon, saying "Farewell, stars!" yet never hearing a reply as it doesn't seem the stars do that, and being by myself.

Ultimately, what came out of it was the fracture of our friend group. Iris and Matthew, being a couple, stayed together. She and I were not on the best of terms although with Matthew I was quite indifferent. Priscilla and Evelin remained my friends, something that I'm grateful for to this day.

I thought I was going to be alone again, but I ended up okay.

## Visiting Home, Late November 2019

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/SNA-0.jpg)

In late November, I went home to Southern California to visit my family for the first time since I had moved out of college. I took the train with Kira, Maria, Kira's roommate Montse, Evelin, and Priscilla. My dad picked me up from Santa Ana station at 3 A.M. as is usual of my returns home, and then he drove me to our family home.

It was a surreal experience returning home for the first time. It seemed like so much had happened between when I had left and when I had returned. Writing this right now, the thought that pops up into my mind is the contrast between the summer weeks I spent with my bros Matthew and Intiser having the best September ever immediately being juxtaposed with the still life of the home that I had left and was seeing then. I don't mean that negatively in any way, don't get me wrong. I can only compare it to a deeply buried memory I have as a small child of returning home after visiting Vietnam for the first time since I had moved to the states. I can only compare the contrast of lives between school and home with the contrast of the lives between the states and my birthplace. Somehow, I think of the sick days from back when I went to school K-12. That's the feeling that being home again brought me: safety, security, and family.

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/SNA-1.jpg)

I went to sleep and I didn't see the rest of my family until the next morning when everyone had woken up. The only thing that I have to say is, well, wow. Life seemed to have passed by since I left. My baby niece was continuing to grow up. My friends who stayed in my hometown after high school were all working jobs now or going to school near home.

That Thanksgiving break, I had the opportunity to get caught up with my friends Ethan and Kimberly. I remember one of those nights we were walking through the streets and it was late and I took a Polaroid picture of an intersection down 1st street. I don't remember the specifics of what it was that we were doing, but I remember that we were there and that's what matters.

For Thanksgiving, we went to my uncle's house in Costa Mesa. I remember watching a movie upstairs with my cousin Tony who I had grown up with and who was only younger than me by a year. If I recall correctly, the specific movie we watched was 13 Hours. That was kinda a running theme with us: while the rest of the adults were partying downstairs, we'd usually section away from the crowd and do something together.

Towards the end of Thanksgiving, I met up with my friends again to complete the round trip. I remember it being a long train ride through the night, mostly, and I remember breaking apart from the group briefly on the train to go to the upper compartment and have some alone time. It was a really crowded train -- I definitely remember that.

When we got back to Merced, it was raining. We could have gotten on the bus that was going back to campus, but instead we called an Uber and a truck rolled up and we put our luggage in the truck and made it back to Merced. We were going to order food that night since we hadn't eaten dinner yet but we were just so tired that we all went back to our dorms and went to bed instead.

## The Merced 2020 Project, c. December 2019 -> February 2020

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/m2020-0.jpg)

In December or so, I received training for and started contributing to the Merced 2020 project as part of my job at IT. I remember the morning that I received training. I woke up early before sunrise, made some macaroni and cheese and put it in my thermos for the day, and the dorms were still and asleep. I walked around campus for a little bit to the Glacier/Granite area. My training started at 7 or 8 I believe, and it was around 6 at this time. I realized that I couldn't make it to the Merced 2020 construction site from within campus, so I, worried about being late and missing safety training and orientation, started running to get off-campus so that I could go down Lake Road to enter in through the route that trucks and other heavy machinery would take. In my rush, I fell up the stairs outside the Pavilion and scraped and bruised up my knee.

I eventually did make it to there on time, though. I signed in at the temporary front office building and had a bit of trouble finding the room where I was supposed to be, but eventually made my way there. There weren't many people at safety orientation that morning, just myself and a couple of new construction workers. I remember feeling very, very out of place. Here I was amongst men, big and burly and doing heavy and laborious work. I felt like a boy, no more, scrawny, awkward, shy, and distinctly unfitting of the environment.

To be quite honest, the construction workers weren't very nice to me. I recall that on one of the days I worked on the Merced 2020 project, a worker ran up to me and mockingly asked if I was there for the animals. For context, there was some environmental controversy surrounding the project and if memory serves correctly, there would occasionally be some individuals from some sort of environmental organization who would be brought on the site for regular environmental inspections and surveys. I had to tell him that I wasn't, and that I was actually there for IT. I worked there.

A lot of my memories of the Merced 2020 site were of muddy areas, walking through rough gravel for long periods of time, and doing mundane inventory at our IT storage room on-site. Sometimes, it'd rain and I'd be freezing and my boots would be full of water by the time I made it back to my dorm. My socks were damp the entire long, long walk through the mud and gravel because of course there were no sidewalks. I'd often come back to my dorm completely exhausted and taking off my wet socks and drying and warming my feet with a towel.

It would oftentimes be so foggy that on my way back, I'd have to activate my phone flashlight so that trucks going up and down that stretch of road could see me. It was tough work. It was dirty work, grueling and leaving me cold and my feet frozen by the end of it. Somehow, I find myself longing to relive those memories. I'd do it all over again if I could. The toughest days were my most memorable days.

There are a couple of instances I remember, all on that long stretch of road. Once, I was walking to the site and someone pulled up right next to me on the road and asked if I wanted a lift, to which I gratefully accepted and they took me to the temporary front office building. Another time, I was walking back to my dorm from the site on a particularly foggy day that felt like it might break into rain at any moment, and someone pulled up and asked if I wanted a lift. We talked for a bit. They were an alumni of UC Merced named Matt if I recall correctly, and I believe they majored in Mechanical Engineering and found a position as part of the 2020 project after graduation. It was a very nice talk. He brought me just up behind Half Dome where he mentioned he lived his first or second year too, and then we said goodbyes and I thanked him for the ride. By the time we got there, it was raining. This other time, an older gentleman pulled up next to me as I was walking down that long stretch of road back to my dorm and as you could probably guess, they gave me a lift. They let me off at the intersection. I remember him wishing me "Farewell, young man." Something about that stuck with me. It felt so fatherly and genuine.

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/m2020-1.jpg)

My work at Merced 2020 continued all the way from December until February. In December and January, it was freezing and damp. In February, it was only cold but wet.

I remember a particular Friday afternoon I worked at the Merced 2020 site. I had gotten back on-campus around 5 P.M. or so and the entire world was blue at this time in the afternoon on that December afternoon. Campus was less dense since everyone was probably either in their evening classes or had gone home for the day already. I ran into Priscilla and we got food at the DC, and it was actually my first time being there. If I remember correctly, I got a burrito. We also ran into my roommate Intiser sometime around then and he was doing his work for IT - AET, checking off boxes on a clipboard to satisfy the bureaucracy and all that. Priscilla and I made it back to my dorm where we ate inside and played chess.

The blue hours of twilight somehow always manage to embed themselves into my memory. Whether it is back to my middle school memories of deep self-care evenings while listening to Clams Casino's "I'm God" on repeat, or to this particular day in December coming back from work and spending the night with my friend. Day may be when I'm productive and night may be when I'm dozing to sleep, but the twilight in-between is when I find myself entrenched in a transitional state. I'd imagine it's like coming home from a long day of work to a family, to your friends, your hobbies, and your home.

## Winter Break, c. Late December 2019 -> Late January 2020

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/msq.jpg)

Finals took place in mid-December and went pretty well for me. For SPRK01, I turned in my first undergraduate amateur research paper and for the rest of my classes I took exams. I passed all my classes with an A with the exception of PHYS8 where I got a B. With finals done, we slowly all started to leave campus in waves to head back home.

I remember the days leading up to the start of winter break. Evelin was the first of us to leave as her finals finished the earliest. I remember the night before she left, we stayed up and watched movies and ordered Wingstop. She had an early train the morning after but we stayed up pretty late. In the morning, she texted me as she was waiting for her Uber to the train station and we hugged each other goodbye for the last time that calendar year. Priscilla's dad came to pick up and drive her home. I was the last to go. I headed home via train, alone, leaving behind campus and my dorm for the last time in 2019.

Christmas that year was underwhelming and in fact, I can't even remember what we did. I'm pretty sure we just all gathered at my aunt's house for an extended family dinner or something -- I really just cannot remember. No trip to Wyoming, no Christmas spirit, no particular thing that made it stick out in my mind.

I remember the night of New Year's Eve. I was texting with plenty of friends from high school and catching up, and my best friend Kimberly (mentioned before) and I were considering finding a party to crash or a club to go to. Ultimately, we just decided to relax that night as it came closer and closer to midnight. When the clock finally struck 12 and the calendar read 2020, I got an unexpected text from someone that I had talked to in high school -- my old friend Anna.

To be quite frank, I had neglected my friendship with Anna ever since I had started college. Hopefully that doesn't sound too villainous -- I was in college and needed to focus on my education while she was still in high school and focusing on her own education. It was nice talking to her again and getting back in touch with her, even if we never worked out romantically because the timing just wasn't right. I have many fond memories of high school, a good number of them involving her or at least the time in my life or community that she represented to me.

That winter break, I met with and caught up with my old friends Kevin, and Kim. Kevin was going to UC San Diego as a mathematics major and Kim was finishing up her senior year of high school. I remember sitting at the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf with Kevin and talking about life, our educational journeys thus far, the friends and people we'd met along the way, and so much more. It was great catching up with my friend Kevin again. After I finish up this blog post, I should email him again and ask him how he's been. With Kim, I'd stop by my old high school after classes were done for the day and meet up with Kim, and we'd often walk around and go places like we would back when we were still classmates before I graduated and left for college. I remember when I picked her up one particular January morning, I ran into Anna by chance at school in the old foyer and we hugged for the first time in a while. I remember us going to our go-to spot, Marquez, an authentic Mexican restaurant. Once, we went to a new Cream Pan location that had just recently opened up. We'd also stop by Roasting Waters for some drinks too. I recall a particular night, we got food to-go and went to the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf to hang out and eat.

I also remember hanging out with Justin now that I remember more. We went to try out a Cream Pan location that had just recently opened up nearby. Justin is one of my best friends from high school and even today. He goes to Cal State Fullerton but we're both doing Computer Science (although I'm also doing Computer Engineering) and so it was very nice to catch up with him.

One of the memories I have of that winter break is of going shoe shopping at Kohl's with Justin and Priscilla. My sister had gotten me a coupon for 40% or 60% off of some shoes, and I was desperately in need of new boots. In total, I think I paid $30 or so for the great pair of boots that I wear even to this day. Justin and Priscilla and I also went to the Block (what is now known as the Outlets at Orange) to browse around and hang out. It was a nice day. Memories of days like that stay in my mind.

I recall days that I'd spend in my room, late at night, doing programming or watching The Office or whatever while everyone else was asleep and the house was still. I loved moments like that, although I must admit that I didn't love the moments when my baby niece would wake up in the middle of the night and start screaming. I'm not a big fan of kids.

Just before winter break had started, Evelin, Priscilla, and I were invited to be a part of a Secret Santa game. I had gotten Evelin. That winter break, I was making a very special present for her: a handmade doll of her wearing her favorite sweater. I had gotten steady progress of it over winter break and through it, I learned how to knit and sew.

This one particular day, Justin and I went to Micro Center to do some shopping. I was shopping for some parts for a hovercraft project that I wanted to start that winter and work on and finish up in the spring semester. Sadly, I had to abandon that project that winter break although I remember many nights I spent in my room creating circuit diagrams and shopping for parts. Fun times.

In mid-January, my family had a birthday dinner at Red Flame. We decide to celebrate both my sister's and my own birthday on the same day since I was due to leave back to Merced very soon. On January 20th, I woke up in the early morning and my dad drove me up to the train station, where I caught the morning train to L.A. Union Station, met up with Evelin, and then we went back to Merced together. I had two rolls of Banh Tet that my mom had packed for me as a reminder of home and our culture which I was growing apart from more and more every single day. I remember us arriving at Merced Station and there were lots of other students there with a lot of luggage, and we were hesitant to get on the CatTracks bus as it looked like it was way overfilled to the maximum. Knowing the city just a tad bit more well than the rest of them who were packed like sardines in there, I convinced Evelin that another bus, the city bus, was coming soon. We waited at the bus stop for it to come and I remember us sitting alone, together in that bus that night as we went back to campus.

When we got back to campus, it was truly a feeling of relief and warmth. I felt like I was home, again, safe and secure. The spring semester had officially started.

## A Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Night, 22 January 2020

Not too long after we had come back from winter break, I immediately went back to work. This one particular night I remember in complete detail because it was absolutely terrible and perhaps a harbinger for the terrible rest of the year that 2020 would be.

On Wednesdays, I worked at the Downtown Campus Center from 6:45 P.M. to 10 P.M., except this semester was a bit different because classes ended a bit later than they did in the fall and so I could not catch the G line bus to get home. This meant that I had to take the C1 line instead that went much later into the night, whose nearest stop was Paul's Place. A long walk through the night, which I didn't mind because it gave me some time for thought, reflection, and solitude alone, although I'd be lying if I said that at least half of my mind wasn't focused on self-defense, awareness, and possibly what some may consider to be paranoia.

I walked through the night. Alone. Cold. And the bus never came. By all means, it should have. The university's TAPS website said that all the buses were running again. The schedule said that there should have been at least two that would have come for me, the last two going home. Neither ever came. I was out there for a while, a long time, my phone battery almost completely drained.

I'm glad that my friend was able to call someone to pick me up instead, but that night remains in my memory as one of the worst. I don't know what I would have done had I not been saved. My phone would have died. The city would be asleep. I'd be left with no way to get home. In the city. In the night. In the cold. Alone. Dark.

The rest of 2020 would not end up being too good either.

## A Typical Pre-COVID Spring Week, c. January -> February 2020

That spring semester, I was taking CSE15 (Discrete Mathematics), PHYS9 (Physics II), and MATH23 (Vector Calculus). Pretty easy schedule, honestly. Still did Robotics. Still volunteered for Sustainability.

Mondays, I usually didn't go to my 7:30 A.M. CSE15 labs except for a few times at the beginning of the semester because nothing productive really happened at labs. In order for me to program at maximum efficiency, I need to be in my zone. What I did go to were my 11:30 A.M. MATH23 lectures with Keith Thompson, one of the best professors I've ever had, and then the associated discussion a bit later at 1:30 P.M. also with Keith Thompson in a small discussion room on the second floor of COB1. Later in the day at 4:30 P.M., I'd go to CSE15 with Angelo Kyrilov and afterwards head to my PHYS9 discussion located on the other side of campus at Glacier Point. I had a lot of gaps in my schedule and not many things were back-to-back.

On Tuesdays, I worked at the Promenade in the morning from 10 A.M. until 1 P.M., take the Route UC back to campus, and make it to IT just time time for my shift from 2 P.M. until 5 P.M. where I usually worked alone. At night, I'd go to my PHYS9 lectures with Carrie Menke, another amazing professor.

Wednesdays were my busiest days, by far. In the morning, I'd wake up early to go to a PHYS9 lab from 8:30 A.M. until 10:20 A.M., enjoy the only gap I had that day from 10:20 A.M. until 11:30 A.M., and then make it to MATH23 in time for lecture. After lecture was finished, I went straight to work at IT network all the way until my evening CSE15 lecture. Right after CSE15, I'd head straight to catching the bus and then go work my night shift at the Downtown Campus Center all the way until late night when I'd walk for half an hour or so and take a different bus back. I usually woke up a little bit earlier to get breakfast, so from 7:30 A.M. all the way until 11:20 P.M., I was out. Busy, busy, busy!

Thursdays were relaxing. I had no classes on Thursdays except for my PHYS9 lecture. I usually dedicated my Thursdays to teaching my old course "Introduction to Cybersecurity in Application" (ICA) in the morning from 8 until 9, delivering a lecture and some live demos. I usually dedicated all the time afterwards to volunteering for Sustainability as much as I could.

On Fridays, I had nothing except for MATH23 in the noon. Free day. Friday. I loved that schedule.

One thing that I do remember particularly well about this semester, though, was that it was a lot rainier than the fall semester. On some particularly memorable nights, I'd walk to the Downtown Campus Center from the bus stop and the world would be glistening with reflections and puddles after the world had had its shower. The lights would be bright and reflecting, yet the city would retain its signature darkness and sleepiness and it prepared for slumber, leaving me walking through its streets as one who stayed up to make the world work while others would lay down and resign for the day.

## A Terrible February and March, c. February -> March 2020

![](../uploads/2020-10-19/campus-3.jpg)

In February, my mental health took a turn for the worst as all of the stress I had been holding in for so long finally came out. It's much too private for me to talk about, even on my own blog, so I'll only recount the good and memorable parts of February.

The nights had this odd sort of warmth to them although anyone who's lived in Merced knows that the Februaries here can be unforgivingly frosty. The campus was oftentimes silent at night when I'd go out for rides on my longboard to clear my mind. The lights, warm, orange, and cozy, providing me with some sort of solace and being my only companions on those nights I spent on-campus looking out, wondering, wandering, thinking, alone. The only others who would be awake around those times would be the occasional campus police officer making their nightly patrols, or perhaps another insomniac such as myself who would cede and give up fighting against their insomnia and instead choose to ride out the wave outside.

March was worse. That's when remote learning started.

I remember that weekend. Pi day. The 14th of March. Evelin and I went to town to get ingredients for an apple pie and I remember us sitting at the mall afterwards talking while waiting for our bus. I didn't know it then, but that'd be our last real face-to-face, one-on-one, private conversation for a long time. It was nice, just the two of us talking. Usually we'd be in a group setting, but not then. The bus eventually came, we caught it, and went back to campus to bake an apple pie. On the bus, I have very photographic memories of us sitting next to each other while talking about life as the golden hour sunlight hit.

And that was a good weekend. On Monday, she left early for spring break and she planned to come back afterwards. That Monday morning was a rainy morning. We hugged our goodbyes as she left, and as I had begun to walk across campus to the Health Center for private reasons. She texted me later that day when she arrived back home safe and sound. It was nice knowing that she was with her family again, where she'd be safe amidst all the chaos that was currently going down in the world. I looked forward to seeing her again once spring break was over.

That same day, we got the news: someone had COVID-19. The rest of that week was a blur. I came to work at the Promenade the next day only to receive news in the middle of my shift that we were about to go remote and that we had been ordered to pack up. I said goodbye to the Promenade for the last time. I went to work at IT network. Same story.

In only a few days, my college life was ripped from me.

I started packing. I was going home. I also helped pack Evelin's stuff so that I could bring it to her instead of her having to come back up just to move out. It all happened so fast. One day I was walking through my college campus. The next day, my two sisters had come to pick me up, bring me home, and I was back home in Southern California with my family.

The rest of the story, the remote learning, the struggling, the stress, and coping with a world that had shut me in after giving me a taste of independence and freedom -- the rest of the story isn't worth telling.

Happy trails, \\
